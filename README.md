# README #

clintrials is a library of clinical trial designs and methods in Python.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This library performs the calculations necessary to run clinical trials.
* It currently has working implementations of O'Quigley et al's CRM and Thall & Cook's EffTox trial designs.
* There is a bias towards phase I and II trial designs because that is my research area.
* I expect to add more phase II and III in future.
* It is written in pure Python.
* Some of the code is fairly mature but the repo itself is young and in flux.
