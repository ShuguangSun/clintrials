{"name":"clintrials","tagline":"Clinical trial designs and methods in Python","body":"### Welcome to clintrials\r\nThis package is a collection of clinical trials designs and methods created by Kristian Brock (@brockk). The aim is to eventually implement calculations for all trial phases but right now, I am focusing on early phase methods, particularly dose-finding designs because this fits with my PhD. \r\n\r\nContained herein is a Python implementation of the O'Quigley's CRM method, inspired by Ken Cheung's R package [dfcrm] (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfcrm/dfcrm.pdf). Rather excitingly, there is also an implementation of Thall & Cook's [EffTox](https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=2). I think this might be the only open source implementation of this powerful but challenging method so that is quite exciting.\r\n\r\nYou can fetch a copy of the package by using buttons above or by using git on your machine:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir clintrials\r\n$ cd clintrials\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/brockk/clintrials.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### API Docs\r\nI have mostly written these, I just need to figure out how to get GitHub to serve the pages. Some light reading for me.","google":"UA-38049018-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
