are three tutorials provided to complement the publication "Implementing the EffTox Dose-Finding Design in the Matchpoint Trial" (Brock _et al_.,in submission). Please consult the paper for the clinical background, the methodology details, and full explanation of the terminology.

To load these notebooks, you need ipython. 
We recommended you use the Anaconda distribution of Python because it greatly simplifies the process of installing Python and the common add-ons like numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. 

mkdir clintrials
cd clintrials
git clone https://github.com/brockk/clintrials.git
cd tutorials/matchpoint
jupyter notebook




"Test ggplot.ipynb" is a notebook to test whether ggplot is crrectly installed. If you installed Python by Anaconda, you should be able to add ggplot using

pip install ggplot

If you installed Python by other means, that command might also work.
